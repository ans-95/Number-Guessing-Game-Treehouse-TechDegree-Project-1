# Number Guessing Game - Unit 1 Project for TechDegree

The number guessing game is a simple Python program that allows the user to
guess a number from 1 to 10. The user inputs their guess and if it's incorrect,
the user will be given a hint to whether the correct number is higher or lower
than their guess.

The user can guess over and over again until they get the correct
answer. The user will then be told how many attempts it took for them to guess
the correct number and basic statistics related to this round of the guessing game.
If the user enters a number outside of the 1 to 10 range or an non integer input, they'll
be given an error message, the input doesn't count to the user's attempt counter
and they'll be asked to try again and enter a number from 1 to 10.

The user will then be asked if they want to continue playing the game or not. If the
user enters yes, they can play again with updated statistics at the end of this round.
If the user enters no, the user will be given a good bye message and the program will
ends.
